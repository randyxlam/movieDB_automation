# movieDB_automation

Movie TMDB API simple automated tests.

The project was created using a Maven quickstart template and RESTAssured.
The tests are located at: quickstart/src/test/java/movieDB/quickstart.

The runnable tests are located in the Movies.java class. 

To execute you'll want to use your own API KEY which has been parameterized in the Base_RT class which the other 
test classes are extended off of.

To execute the tests in the Movie.java class, just run them as a jUnit test.
